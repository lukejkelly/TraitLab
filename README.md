# TraitLab with lateral transfer.

## Description

Code which extends the Stochastic Dollo model ([Nicholls and Gray, 2008][1]; [Ryder and Nicholls, 2011][2]) implementation in _TraitLab_ [(Nicholls, Ryder and Welch)][3] to include lateral transfer ([Kelly and Nicholls, 2016][4].


## Analysis

There are two ways to run an analysis:
* Interactively: start Matlab, change directory to TraitLab/, run the `TraitLab` command.
* Bach mode: set the appropriate options in the _.par_ file.
In either case, proceed according to the description in the [_TraitLab_ manual] #[3].

Open the analysis GUI from the main _TraitLab_ GUI to analyse samples at the end of a run.
